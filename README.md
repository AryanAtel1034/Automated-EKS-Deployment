# Automated-EKS-Deployment (Devops) 
- Deploying EKS clusters and applications with CI/CD using Jenkins and Terraform streamlines the orchestration and management of Kubernetes clusters. Jenkins automates the CI/CD pipeline, facilitating continuous integration and delivery, while Terraform handles the infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision and manage EKS clusters efficiently.
